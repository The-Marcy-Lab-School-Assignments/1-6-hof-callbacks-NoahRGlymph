# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer

The problem is that printDouble() is called immediately instead of being passed as a callback function to forEach. This means that printDouble is invoked before the forEach method is even called, and the return value of printDouble (which is undefined) is passed to forEach instead of the function itself.
